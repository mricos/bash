pshell: Electron shell theory comes from Sommerfield's modification
of the Bohr model- he added slghtly elliptical orbits (quantum
numbers l and m) to explain the file lines of Hydrogen spectra.

The P in electron theory stands for principle. The P shell is 
contained by the all shells except the sharp shell, S.

In electron theory the P Shell is considered a subshell located 
in the heart of all shells (L, M, M) except smallest subshell, K. 

In the context of this Bash script, the p-shell is included 
by larger shells to provide additional commands to common shell.
